In C++, every class has four core special functions called the canonical form (or Coplien’s form):

1. Default constructor — makes a new, empty object.
2. Copy constructor — makes a new object as a copy of another.
3. Copy assignment operator — replaces this object’s content by another’s.
4. Destructor — cleans up when the object dies.
