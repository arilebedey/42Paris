If you set `#define TILE_SIZE 32` but still want to use 64x64 collectibles, you need to handle the rendering of the collectibles carefully to ensure they fit visually within the 32x32 grid system. Here are the steps you can take:

---

### 1. **Center the Collectibles in the 32x32 Grid**

Since the collectibles are larger than the grid tiles, you can center them within the 32x32 tiles. To do this, you need to offset their position when rendering. For example:

```c
mlx_put_image_to_window(game->mlx, game->win, game->img_collectible,
    x * TILE_SIZE - (64 - TILE_SIZE) / 2,
    y * TILE_SIZE - (64 - TILE_SIZE) / 2);
```

Explanation:

- \( 64 - TILE_SIZE = 32 \): This is the difference between the collectible size and the tile size.
- Divide by 2 to center the collectible: \( (64 - TILE_SIZE) / 2 = 16 \).
- Subtract this offset from the position to center the collectible within the smaller tile.

### 2. **Adjust Collision Logic**

Even though the collectible sprite is visually larger, the game logic should still treat it as occupying a single 32x32 tile. This means you don't need to change the collision detection or map parsing logic, as it already works based on the grid system.

---

### 3. **Ensure Visual Consistency**

If the collectibles are larger than the tiles, they might overlap with adjacent tiles. To avoid this looking awkward:

- Make sure the collectibles are visually distinct and don't interfere with other elements (e.g., walls, player, enemies).
- Test the placement of collectibles in your map to ensure they don't overlap with other sprites.

---

### 4. **Scale Down the Collectibles (Optional)**

If the larger collectibles look out of place, you can scale them down to 32x32 using a graphics editor or dynamically during rendering. However, scaling down dynamically in MiniLibX is not straightforward, so pre-scaling the images is recommended.

---

### 5. **Update the Rendering Logic**

In your `render_map` function (in `create_map.c`), update the part where collectibles are rendered. Replace this:

```c
mlx_put_image_to_window(game->mlx,
    game->win, game->img_collectible[game->current_frame],
    *x * TILE_SIZE, *y * TILE_SIZE);
```

With:

```c
mlx_put_image_to_window(game->mlx,
    game->win, game->img_collectible[game->current_frame],
    *x * TILE_SIZE - (64 - TILE_SIZE) / 2,
    *y * TILE_SIZE - (64 - TILE_SIZE) / 2);
```

This ensures the collectibles are centered within the smaller tiles.

---

### 6. **Test the Game**

After making these changes, test the game thoroughly:

- Ensure the collectibles are visually centered and don't overlap with other elements.
- Verify that the collision detection and gameplay logic still work as expected.

---

### Final Thoughts

Using 64x64 collectibles with a 32x32 grid can work, but it requires careful handling of rendering offsets to maintain visual consistency. If the larger collectibles feel out of place, consider scaling them down to match the grid size. Let me know if you'd like help implementing these changes!
