The thread wakes up periodically in `msleep` because of the **short sleep intervals** implemented using `usleep`. Let’s break this down step by step to explain how the thread "wakes up" and checks the elapsed time:

### **How `msleep` Works**

The `msleep` function uses a loop to repeatedly call `usleep` for small intervals (e.g., 500 microseconds) and checks the elapsed time after each interval. This periodic wake-up is achieved by the following mechanism:

1. **Start Time Recording**:

   - At the beginning of the function, the current time is recorded using `get_time()` (which returns the current time in milliseconds).
   - This serves as the reference point for calculating the elapsed time.

2. **Short Sleep Intervals**:

   - Inside the loop, the thread sleeps for a short duration using `usleep(500)`. This pauses the thread for 500 microseconds (0.5 milliseconds).
   - After the `usleep` call finishes, the thread resumes execution.

3. **Elapsed Time Check**:

   - After waking up from `usleep`, the thread checks the elapsed time by comparing the current time (`get_time()`) with the recorded start time.
   - If the desired sleep duration has been reached, the loop exits, and the function ends.

4. **Repeat Until Desired Duration**:
   - If the desired sleep duration has not yet been reached, the thread goes back to sleep for another 500 microseconds.
   - This process repeats until the total elapsed time matches or exceeds the specified duration.

### **How the Thread Wakes Up Periodically**

The thread "wakes up" after each `usleep(500)` call. This happens because `usleep` only blocks the thread for the specified duration (500 microseconds). Once the sleep period ends, the thread resumes execution and performs the next operation in the loop (checking the elapsed time).

Here’s the sequence of events:

1. The thread calls `usleep(500)` and goes to sleep for 500 microseconds.
2. After 500 microseconds, the thread wakes up and resumes execution.
3. The thread checks the elapsed time using `get_time()`.
4. If the desired sleep duration has not been reached, the thread calls `usleep(500)` again and repeats the process.

This periodic wake-up allows the thread to remain responsive and check the elapsed time multiple times during the total sleep duration.

### **Code Walkthrough**

Here’s the `msleep` function again for reference:

```c
void msleep(size_t ms) {
    size_t start = get_time(); // Record the start time
    while (get_time() - start < ms) { // Check elapsed time
        usleep(500); // Sleep for 500 microseconds
    }
}
```

Let’s assume the thread needs to sleep for 10 milliseconds (\(ms = 10\)):

1. **Start Time**:

   - The thread records the current time, e.g., \( \text{start} = 1000 \) milliseconds.

2. **First Iteration**:

   - The thread calls `usleep(500)` and sleeps for 500 microseconds.
   - After waking up, the thread checks the elapsed time: \( \text{get_time()} - \text{start} = 0.5 \) milliseconds.
   - Since \( 0.5 < 10 \), the thread goes back to sleep.

3. **Second Iteration**:

   - The thread calls `usleep(500)` again and sleeps for another 500 microseconds.
   - After waking up, the thread checks the elapsed time: \( \text{get_time()} - \text{start} = 1.0 \) milliseconds.
   - Since \( 1.0 < 10 \), the thread goes back to sleep.

4. **Repeat Until 10 Milliseconds**:
   - This process repeats until \( \text{get_time()} - \text{start} \geq 10 \).
   - Once the desired duration is reached, the loop exits, and the function ends.

### **Why This Works**

The thread wakes up periodically because `usleep` only blocks the thread for the specified duration (500 microseconds). After each `usleep` call, the thread resumes execution and performs the next operation in the loop (checking the elapsed time). This periodic wake-up allows the thread to:

- Check the elapsed time multiple times during the total sleep duration.
- React to external events (e.g., simulation termination) if necessary.

---

### **Comparison to Direct `usleep`**

If the thread used `usleep` directly for the full duration (e.g., `usleep(10000)` for 10 milliseconds), it would remain completely blocked for the entire duration. During this time:

- The thread would not wake up to check the elapsed time.
- The thread would be unresponsive to external events (e.g., simulation termination).

By breaking the sleep into smaller intervals, `msleep` ensures that the thread wakes up periodically and remains responsive.

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- The thread wakes up periodically in `msleep` because the sleep duration is broken into smaller intervals using `usleep(500)`.
- After each interval, the thread resumes execution and checks the elapsed time.
- This approach allows the thread to remain responsive and ensures precise timing for the desired sleep duration.
