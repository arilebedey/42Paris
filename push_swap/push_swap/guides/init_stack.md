Here's the renamed `init_stack` function with a detailed explanation:

```c
void init_circular_stack(t_context *ctx, t_stack *stk, int capacity)
{
    stk->values = malloc(sizeof(int) * capacity);
    if (!stk->values)
        handle_error(ctx);
    stk->top_idx = 0;
    stk->bottom_idx = 0;
    stk->size = capacity;
    ft_memset(stk->values, 0, sizeof(int) * capacity);
}
```

## Explanation of `init_circular_stack`

This function initializes a circular stack data structure with the following steps:

### Parameters:
- `ctx`: The overall program context (renamed from `data`)
- `stk`: Pointer to the stack structure being initialized
- `capacity`: Maximum number of elements the stack can hold (renamed from `size`)

### Function Operations:

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Allocates memory for the stack values array using `malloc`
   - The size is calculated based on the number of integers needed (capacity)

2. **Error Handling**:
   - If memory allocation fails, calls `handle_error` (renamed from `error`)
   - This ensures the program exits gracefully instead of crashing

3. **Stack Initialization**:
   - Sets `top_idx` to 0 (index of the top element)
   - Sets `bottom_idx` to 0 (index of the bottom element)
   - Sets `size` to the maximum capacity
   - The fact that both indices start at 0 means the stack is initially empty

4. **Zero Initialization**:
   - Uses `ft_memset` to set all elements to 0
   - This provides a clean initial state for the stack

### Key Improvements in Naming:

1. `init_stack` → `init_circular_stack`: Explicitly states this is a circular stack implementation
2. `data` → `ctx`: Shorter version of "context"
3. `stk->stack` → `stk->values`: Clarifies this array holds the actual values
4. `stk->top` → `stk->top_idx`: Specifies this is an index, not a value
5. `stk->bottom` → `stk->bottom_idx`: Specifies this is an index, not a value
6. `size` parameter → `capacity`: More accurate description of what this represents

### Circular Stack Concept:

The function sets up a circular stack where:
- Elements can be accessed from both ends (top and bottom)
- The stack is implemented as an array with indices that wrap around
- A stack is empty when both indices point to the same position and the value is 0
- Functions like `next_up` and `next_down` (which would be renamed to `prev_index` and `next_index`) handle the circular nature by wrapping around when necessary

This circular implementation is crucial for the push_swap algorithm, as it allows efficient rotation operations without physically moving multiple elements in memory.
