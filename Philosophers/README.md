### Threads

Memory is shared across all threads.

Using threads can lead to race conditions because sometime each thread read from its own CPU register (not to be confused with CPU memory) and a value that was changed by another thread, not have been updated in the CPU register of the other thread.

Each thread can have its own set of CPU registers, which act as temporary storage for data being processed.

This is related to cache coherence and memory visibility issues in multithreaded programming. Without proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, atomic operations, or memory barriers), threads may not see the most up-to-date values of shared variables.

The C standard does not guarantee atomicity for all types and platforms, thus, locking before writing/reading needs to be implemented on all variables that can be written to by more than 1 thread.

#### Creating a thread

```c
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr,
                   void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg);
```

- thread: Pointer to the thread identifier.
- attr: Thread attributes (can be NULL for default attributes).
- start_routine: Function executed by the thread.
- arg: Argument passed to the thread function.

#### Wait for the main thread

(`pthread_join`) waits for a thread to terminate.

### Approaching the problem

Each philosopher is represented as a separate thread. (`pthread_create`)

The monitor thread is also created to oversee the simulation.

Ensure that the main thread waits for all philosopher threads and the monitor thread to finish before exiting.

### Mutex functions

`pthread_mutex_init` initializes a mutex. Mutexes are used to protect shared resources.
`pthread_mutex_destroy`
`pthread_mutex_lock` will either lock a mutex or wait for the mutex to be unlocked before locking it.
`pthread_mutex_unlock`

### Avoiding busy waiting

- Instead of continuously checking the elapsed time (busy waiting), one can write a function that uses usleep(500) to pause the thread for short intervals.
- This approach reduces CPU usage while maintaining precision, as the thread only wakes up periodically to check the elapsed time.

- When you use usleep directly to sleep for a long duration (e.g., 100 milliseconds), the thread is completely blocked for the entire duration. During this time:

- The thread cannot check for external conditions (e.g., whether the simulation should terminate because a philosopher has died).

### Check for race conditions

`valgrind --tool=helgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./philo`
`valgrind --tool=drd --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./philo`

Helgrind is more resource intensive

### Locking and unlocking by address value to avoid races

Inconsistent lock order can be problematic

- Each philosopher needs two fork mutexes.
- In the naive implementation, every philosopher always locks left_fork first, then right_fork.
- But because forks are shared, what is "left" for one philosopher is "right" for another.
  - Example: Philosopher 1 locks fork[0] then fork[1].
  - Philosopher 2 locks fork[1] then fork[2].
  - Philosopher N locks fork[N] then fork[0].
- This creates a cycle: each thread can hold one fork and wait forever for the other â†’ deadlock.
- Helgrind detects this as a lock-order inversion: one thread locks A then B, another locks B then A.
