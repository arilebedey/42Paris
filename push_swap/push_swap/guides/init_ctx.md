Your renamed structures look good! Let's rename the variables in the `init_context` function (previously `init_data`) while keeping them reasonably short but descriptive.

Here's how I would rename the `init_data` function to `init_context`:

```c
void init_context(t_context *ctx, int argc, char **argv, bool record_ops)
{
    --argc;  // Adjust for program name
    init_stack(ctx, &ctx->stack_a, argc);
    init_stack(ctx, &ctx->stack_b, argc);
    fill_stack(ctx, &ctx->stack_a, argc, ++argv);
    ctx->record_ops = record_ops;
    ctx->op_hist = NULL;
}
```

## Explanation of `init_context`

This function initializes the entire push_swap program context. Let's break it down:

### Parameters:
- `t_context *ctx`: Pointer to the main context structure that holds all program data
- `int argc`: Number of command-line arguments (including program name)
- `char **argv`: Array of command-line argument strings
- `bool record_ops`: Flag to enable/disable recording operations

### Function steps:

1. **Adjust argument count**: 
   ```c
   --argc;
   ```
   Decrements `argc` to get the actual number of values to sort (excluding the program name).

2. **Initialize both stacks**:
   ```c
   init_stack(ctx, &ctx->stack_a, argc);
   init_stack(ctx, &ctx->stack_b, argc);
   ```
   Calls `init_stack` to set up both stack A and stack B with enough capacity for all input values.

3. **Populate stack A with input values**:
   ```c
   fill_stack(ctx, &ctx->stack_a, argc, ++argv);
   ```
   - Increments `argv` to skip the program name
   - Calls `fill_stack` to:
     - Parse and validate the input arguments
     - Convert them to integers
     - Check for duplicates
     - Convert actual values to their ranks (1, 2, 3, ...)
     - Place these ranks in stack A

4. **Set operation recording mode**:
   ```c
   ctx->record_ops = record_ops;
   ```
   Determines whether operations should be recorded (for output) or not (for internal calculations).

5. **Initialize operation history**:
   ```c
   ctx->op_hist = NULL;
   ```
   Starts with an empty operation history list.

### Variable renaming choices:

- `ctx` instead of `data`: More clearly indicates this is the program context
- `record_ops` instead of `writing_mode`: More precisely describes its purpose
- `op_hist` instead of `op_list`: Clarifies that this is a history/record of operations

### Related functions that would need renaming:

- `init_stack` could become `init_circular_stack`
- `fill_stack` could become `populate_stack`
- `error` could become `handle_error`
- `free_data` could become `free_context`

The new naming scheme makes the code's intent much clearer. Now it's obvious that this function:
1. Sets up the program's environment
2. Prepares two stacks
3. Loads and validates input values into the first stack
4. Configures operation recording
5. Creates an empty operation history

This establishes the initial state before the sorting algorithm begins its work.
